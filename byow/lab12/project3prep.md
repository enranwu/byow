# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: I followed the implementation of the staff one.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: I think the hexagons can represented different rooms placed at random places of the map. However, the size of these rooms can be different as opposed to the hexagons.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would probably writing the method of drawing out a single room first.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: I am not too sure for now.
